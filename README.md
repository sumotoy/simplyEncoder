# simplyEncoder
A simple library for most encoders and micros, always works
<br>
There's tons of libraries for that but this one has one killing feature: It's simple!
It doesn't use interrupts, timers, port manipulation, etc. Just simple code and straight pin reading so it will
always work and it's fully compatible with most micros.<br>
In addition it can decode 2 type of encoders, the most popular ones and the High Resolution EBE's.<br>
It has been coded for use with human interfaces, panels, etc where the extreme precision it's not needed.

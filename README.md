# simplyEncoder
A simple tiny library for most encoders and micros that always works!
<br>
There's tons of libraries out there but this one has one killing feature: It's tiny simple!
It doesn't use interrupts, timers, port manipulation, etc. Just simple code and straight pin reading so it will
always work and it's fully compatible with most micros and ide's.<br>
In addition it can decode 2 type of encoders, the most popular ones and the High Resolution EBE's.<br>
It has been coded for use with human interfaces, panels, etc where the extreme precision it's not needed.<br>
Of course it use limited resources and has tiny memory impact as well .)<br>
